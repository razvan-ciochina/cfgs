1. Don't forget to run :PlugInstall after you've copied everything in your homedir.
2. Install clangd and clang-tools for autocompletion.
3. For your own sanity when using Autotools projects or ones that just use make also install bear in order to 
get a compile_commands.json file.
4. For youcompleteme you need python3-dev build-essential and cmake3 on ubuntu. Find equivalent for your distro.
5. You need to run the following command in the YouCompleteMe folder install.py --clangd-completer.
6. Enjoy pain.
